# Customer Churn Prediction Project README

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create predictions regarding customer churn and retention and provide valuable insights to the company based on the dataset. Specifically, our goals are:

1. Develop predictive models to identify customers likely to churn and those likely to stay.
2. Provide insights and recommendations to the company based on the dataset analysis.

## Models and Performance

In this project, we have utilized TensorFlow to build predictive models using both the Sequential and Functional APIs. 
After model creation and evaluation, we found that the Sequential model outperformed the Functional model in terms of predictive accuracy and performance.

## Insights and Recommendations

The analysis of the dataset has revealed several key insights, one of which is the high number of customers using the basic membership package. Additionally, non-membership usage ranks second in terms of customer distribution. This finding suggests an opportunity for the marketing department to focus on strategies to encourage more customers to subscribe to memberships or to enhance their existing membership plans. These insights can aid the company in customer retention efforts and improving customer satisfaction.
